Within the /BookCode directory you will find source code from the book
separated by chapter.

Running the demos and applications
 
All chapter demos and applications have come precompiled, meaning that you can check out all the advanced animation goodness before delving into the book. All demos can run in either a windowed or fullscreen video video mode, as decided by you when the program starts. To run a demo in fullscreen video mode (640x480x16), select Yes whenever the programs asks to run in fullscreen. To exit any of the programs, hold down the ALT key and press F4 (ALT+F4), or if using windowed mode, just click on the menu bar's Close icon.
 
Following is a list of demos and applications you can find in the \BookCode directory of this CD-ROM.
